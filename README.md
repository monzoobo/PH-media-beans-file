Note : due to the age of some designs and the turnover inside the organisation, it is often hard to trace back where assets come from. If one of your productions is displayed here please reach out to me so i can properly credit you.

<h3><ins>License :</ins></h3>

All the documents here are free to use in the context of Pandemic Horde's media production an affiliated works. If you plan on using them for other projects, please credit the authors if you find their name and put a link to this page in which they will be credited for their work.

Note that some assets, such as EVE ship's silhouettes, are the property of CCP. Be careful using these, specially if you plan on selling something with it (tshirt etc. for example).

<h3><ins>Contribution :</ins></h3>

I'm planning on making it possible for anyone from the sig to edit this eventually but for now both my little understanding of github and the need for a well structured data base makes it so you'll have to submit the stuff you want me to add in.
Feel free to do so by sending the files (if possible in high resolution and with a good naming) to Monzoobo#8521 over on discord.
