<ins>Contribution :</ins>

I'm planning on making it possible for anyone from the sig to edit this eventually but for now both my little understanding of github and the need for a well structured data base makes it so you'll have to submit the stuff you want me to add in.
Feel free to do so by sending the files (if possible in high resolution and with a good naming) to Monzoobo#8521 over on discord.
